Join the lamebook revolution!

I was asked to turn this into a real challenge because it would be more clear. I agree! Thanks, @Robert Wolfe (Johnson).

Also everyone, please don’t feel like you have to do this. If you have time, though, it’s a great way to play around a bit with some of the new things we’ve been learning.

Here’s what you do:
1. Fork the repo at https://github.com/ericelvendahl/lamebook and clone it to your local machine. If you’ve forgotten how to do any of this (it’s so easy to forget), check back to week 1 or ask here. The repetition is helpful to everyone!
2. Create a new branch to work on. This page does a great job of explaining what that command does. Scroll to the part about new branches: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout
3. Add yourself to the project. In index.html, add your name and link to the page you will create in /users/[your name]/
4. Then, submit a pull request and I’ll add it to the repo. You can learn how to do that in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ
