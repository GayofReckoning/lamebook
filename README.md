# lamebook

Hey, other devs!
Some things you might want to add for yourselves:

1. A link to your page in the unordered list in index.html. Mine is in /users/eric/eric.html
2. Make your changes locally and then watch this video on how pull requests work. It's a quick one and it's good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ Note that he uses EMACS on the command line. Don't let that distract you. Just use Atom or VSCode.
3. Make sure that your page is lame enough
