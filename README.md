Hey, other devs!
Some things you might want to add for yourselves and a few notes:

1. A link to your page in the unordered list in index.html. Mine is in /users/eric/eric.html
2. Make your changes locally and then watch this video on how pull requests work. It's a quick one and it's good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ Note that he uses EMACS on the command line. Don't let that distract you. Just use Atom or VSCode.
3. In the above example he creates a new branch (a new thing for us! yay!) using git checkout -b [new branch name]. This is a shortcut that could be a bit confusing. This page does a great job of explaining what that command does. Scroll to the part about new branches: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout
4. Make sure that your page is sufficiently lame.
